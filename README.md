# DevLogic
DevLogic is an accessible, crowd-sourced repository of engineering knowledge - housing how developers are building and implementing different features across platforms.

The goal is to build a wealth of knowledge that would help improve the thinking and problem solving of developers from junior to mid and seniors with the kinds of problems they are able to solve.

## Content Contribution
While the development is ongoing, we are able to gather content set in the `content` folder. If you are ready to start sharing your wealth of knowledge, you can already start sending in PRs. 

### Contribution Guide
Additional content contribution guidelines can be found in [.contributing.md](./contributing.md)
