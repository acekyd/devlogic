# Implementing an example Web category post
So the reality of all that we are building keeps following us around. 

Welcome to my first blog post using \[content v2 module\](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)
Hey there! üëãüèæ
This is my first blog post learning nuxt content.
I'm currently building it using the following:
- Nuxt.js
- Nuxt Content module
- TailwindCSS
    - TailwindCSS typography

## Nuxt.js
\[Nuxt\](https://nuxtjs.org/) is a powerful Vue framework that offers excellent development features such as server-side rendering.

```bash
npx nuxi init nuxt-app
cd nuxt-app
yarn install
